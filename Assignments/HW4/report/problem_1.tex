\section*{Problem 1:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The breakdown in nonsymmetric Lanczos process occurs
\begin{itemize}
\item when $v_{k}$ or $w_{k}$ is a zero vector. This is the case where $V$ spans $K_{k}
\left\lbrace A,r \right\rbrace$ or $W$ spans $K_{k}\left\lbrace A^{T},c \right\rbrace$. The is a termination condition and occurs when $k$ reaches $d(A,r)$ or $d(A^{T},c)$. Since, $d(A,r) \geq 2$ and $d(A^{T},c) \geq 2$, then this is not the case. 

\item when $w_{k}^{T}v_{k} =0$. Since $v_{k}$ and $w_{k}$ is the normalized $r$ and $c$ respectively for $k=1$. Then, $w_{k}^{T}v_{k} = 0$ for $k=1$ and breakdown will occur since $w_{k}^{T}v_{k}$ is used as the denominator to compute $\alpha_{k}$ leading to division by zero. 
\end{itemize}

\item At step $k = 2$, a breakdown will occur if 
$$
\delta_{2} = w_{2}^{T}v_{2} = 0
$$
Assuming that $r$ and $c$ are normalized (i.e., $\parallel r\parallel_{2} = \parallel c\parallel_{2} =1$), we can re-write the above condition as 

$$
w_{2}^{T}v_{2} = (A^{T}w_{1} - \alpha_{1}w_{1})^{T} (Av_{1} - \alpha_{1}v_{1}) = 0
$$
That could happens if  $(A^{T}w_{1} - \alpha_{1}w_{1})^{T}=0$ or $Av_{1} = \alpha_{1}v_{1}$. Thus, 

$$
Av_{1} = \alpha_{1}v_{1}
$$
$$
Ar = \alpha_{1}r
$$
$$
Ar = \frac{c^{T}Ar}{c^{T}r}r
$$
$$
(c^{T}r)(Ar) = (c^{T}Ar)(r)
$$
$$
(c^{T}r)(A) = (c^{T}Ar)
$$
$$
(c^{T}r)(c^{T}A^{2}r) = (c^{T}Ar)^{2}
$$

\end{enumerate}
