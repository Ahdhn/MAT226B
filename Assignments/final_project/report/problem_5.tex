\section*{Problem 5:}
\paragraph{System Specs:} All our experiments run on Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1280 v5 with 3.70 GHz and 32 GB of RAM on 64-bit operating system running Windows 7. 

\paragraph{Code:} We provide a single file \texttt{driver.m} that generates all the data in the tables and plots by running it. It calls the necessary function and load the examples one after another. 
 
\paragraph{Plots:} Figure~\ref{fig:all} shows the results of the three algorithms plotted on top of each others. It shows that Lanczos-based algorithm is able to capture $Z(s)$ almost exactly using $k=100$. For such value of $k$, the textbook algorithm will return NaN everywhere. Thus, we used $k=10$ in the plot. Function \texttt{Figure\_1()} in \texttt{driver.m} file generates this plot.

   \caption{The results of the three algorithms; exact algorithm, textbook algorithm with $k=10$, and Lanczos-based algorithm with $k=100$. We used expansion point $s_{0} = \expnumber{1}{5} + 2\pi i \expnumber{5.5}{8}$ for both algorithms.   }
   \label{fig:all}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{$s_0$ with fast convergence:} We test our implementation of the textbook and Lanczos-based algorithm for different values of $s_{0}$ and found that it runs fairly fast for the small input given in \texttt{FP\_Ex1.mat}; it takes less than a second even for large i.e., $k < 100$. 

We followed the recommendation given in the lectures for how to pick $s_{0}$. We choose $s_{0} = \expnumber{1}{5} + 2\pi i \expnumber{5.5}{8} $. 

\paragraph{Comparison:} We run both our implementation for different values of $k$ and the above $s_{0}$ and compared between both. Table~\ref{tab:comp} shows the average different ($\parallel \cdot \parallel^{2}$) and the maximum (absolute) different between the two vectors containing the output of both algorithms for different values of $s$. Function \texttt{Table\_1()} in \texttt{driver.m} file generates these data. We can see that when $k>13$, the two algorithms will give difference numerical results.

\paragraph{Explanation:} We believe the reason why the textbook algorithm does not perform well is because it depends on computing $M^{j}r$ (to compute the moments) for increasing values of $j$ which convergences quickly to the the eigenvector of $M$ with largest eigenvalue. Thus, the information it contains comes from a single eigenvector where the information should comes from all eigenvectors of $M$. In contrast, Lanczos's $T_{k}$ represents oblique projection of $M$ onto the $K_{k}(M,r)$ Krylov subspace which contains information about $k$ eigenvectors. 

\paragraph{Lanczos approach with difference $s_{0}$:} For this experiment, we defined the ``good approximation'' such that the average difference between the Lanczos-based algorithm and the exact algorithm is less than  $10^{-5}$. We tested using different $s_{0}$ and for each value we run the algorithm in a loop for $200\leq k \leq 1000$ and stop when the results meet the good-approximation criterion we set thus obtaining the minimum $k$ value that results into the best approximation given $s_{0}$. Table~\ref{tab:s0} show the results for different $s_{0}$. Function \texttt{Table\_2()} in \texttt{driver.m} file generates these data.

We notice that complex $s_{0}$ take more time for the same $k$ value (first and last row in Table~\ref{tab:s0}. Expansion point with complex part equal to the maximum or minimum frequency take double the time it takes for $s_{0}$ suggested in the lecture notes. Getting closer y-axis can results in higher $k$ values and thus slower convergence.
