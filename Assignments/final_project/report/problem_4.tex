\section*{Problem 4:}
We wrote the function \texttt{zkViaLanczos} which computes $Z_k$	given $T_{k}$, $s$ and $s_{0}$. $T_{k}$ is computed from our previous implementation of the nonsymmetric Lanczos in Homework 3 which feed in with the efficient implementation of the $Mv$ and $M^{T}v$ from Problem 2.
