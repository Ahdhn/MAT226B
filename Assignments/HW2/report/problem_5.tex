\section*{Problem 5:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item A single iteration of the CG algorithm requires:
\begin{itemize}
\item Three SAXPY each takes $2n^{2}$ flops
\item Two inner products each takes $2n^{2} -1$
\item Single matrix-vector multiplication which takes for a general (dense) matrix $2n^2-n$
\end{itemize}
Thus, the total flops requires for a single iteration is 
$$
3*2n^{2} + 2*(2n^{2} -1) + 2n^2-n = 12 n^{2} - n - 2 \text{\ flops}
$$

\item The $k-$iterate of the CG algorithm has the following property
$$
\frac{\shortparallel x^{*} - x_{k} \shortparallel_{A}}{\shortparallel x^{*} - x_{0} \shortparallel_{A}} \leq 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{\kappa}-1}{\sqrt{\kappa}+1}\right) ^{k}
$$

where $x^{*}$ is the solution i.e.,  $x^{*} = A^{-1}b$ and $\kappa$ is the condition number of $A$. Given that $\shortparallel x^{*} - x_{0} \shortparallel_{A} = \frac{1}{2}$ and $\kappa = 9$, then to find the minimum number $k$ of iterations that generates $\shortparallel x^{*} - x_{k} \shortparallel_{A} \leq 10^{-12}$ we need to solve for $k$ in the following equation 
$$
\frac{10^{-12}}{0.5} \leq 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{9}-1}{\sqrt{9}+1}\right) ^{k}
$$
which gives $k<= 39.8631$. Thus, \textbf{the minimum number of iteration is $40$}.

\item Solving $Ax = b$ via Cholesky factorization requires three steps; first the decomposition of $A = LL^{T}$ which requires (from Homework 1)
$$
n + \frac{1}{2}n(n-1) + \frac{1}{3}n(n^2-1) \text{\ flops}
$$
Second, the forward substitution which requires 
$$
\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(1+2k) = n^{2} \text{\ flops}
$$
Third, the backward substitution which requires also $n^{2}$ flops. Thus, the total number of flops to solver $Ax = b$ is 

$$
n + \frac{1}{2}n(n-1) + \frac{1}{3}n(n^2-1) + 2n^{2} = \frac{1}{3}n^{3} + \frac{5}{2}n^{2} + \frac{1}{6}n \text{\ flops}
$$

While solving the same system using CG up to $k=40$ iterations requires (ignoring the initial operation to calculate $r_{0}$) 
$$
480 n^{2} - 40n - 80 \text{\ flops}
$$

\item Using only the term of the highest power of $n$, the matrix size $n$ for which $k$ CG iteration (where $k=40$) iterations requires only one tenth of the arithmetic operations that Cholesky approach requires can be obtain from 
$$
480n^{2} = 0.1*\frac{1}{3}n^{3}
$$
which gives $n=14400$
\end{enumerate}
